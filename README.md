# Riihiluoma_Dissertation_Code

Welcome to the github repository for William Riihiluoma's dissertation.  In this repository you will find the Mathematica files used to clean and analyze the survey data described within Dr. Riihiluoma's dissertation.

Due to the timeframes of analysis, some of these files are from earlier in the project, and there were often several similar files in cases where a separate file was needed for each institution or curriculum. The files included thus serve more as examples of the code that was used, and are not all of the code used for the project.
